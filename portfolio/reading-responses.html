      <h2>Week 2</h2>
      <h3>Ulises Carrión: Mail Art and the Big Monster</h3>
      <p>Carrión’s essay is a thought-provoking critique of how Mail Art is commonly misunderstood. Rather than seeing it as simply postcards sent between artists, he reframes it as a method of artistic resistance, using the postal system as a medium for challenging centralized power over communication and art distribution.

        One of the most striking points in the essay is the metaphor of the "Big Monster." Carrión sees the postal system as both a tool and a battleground, where Mail Artists are attempting to bypass institutional control over artistic expression. This resonates with modern debates about digital art distribution—today’s equivalent of the "Big Monster" might be social media algorithms, corporate control over digital platforms, and censorship in online spaces.</p>
      <h4>Discussion Questions:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1. Carrión critiques Mail Art’s claim of being "democratic" by arguing that it still operates within exclusive networks. Do you think any form of art distribution—whether Mail Art, digital platforms, or blockchain-based art—can ever be truly democratic? Why or why not?</li>
        <li>2. The essay describes Mail Art as "knocking on the Monster’s door," challenging institutional control over communication. What modern technologies or artistic practices do you think serve a similar role today in resisting centralized control?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Week 3</h2>
      <h3>Laurel Schwulst & Édouard U.: How Do You Use the Internet Mindfully?</h3>
      <p>The concept of curating knowledge networks rather than passively consuming content stood out. Instead of being led by platform algorithms, Édouard U. suggests that users intentionally build connections between ideas, much like hyperlinking in a personal archive. This concept aligns with decentralized knowledge-sharing, where learning is driven by curiosity rather than commercial interests.

        Overall, this reading pushes for a more human-centered, creative, and autonomous internet experience. It raises important questions about how digital spaces shape identity, creativity, and knowledge consumption in an era dominated by large tech corporations.</p>
      <h4>Discussion Questions:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1. The authors advocate for personal websites as an alternative to corporate platforms. What are the challenges of maintaining a personal digital space, and how can they be addressed to encourage broader adoption?</li>
        <li>2. How does the metaphor of the internet as a garden (versus a factory) change the way we think about digital creation, ownership, and engagement? What would a “mindfully designed” internet look like?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Week 4</h2>
      <h3>Olia Lialina: STILL THERE - Ruins and Templates of Geocities</h3>
      <p>Olia Lialina’s writing reminded me of a yahoo blog I used to write diaries with that got shut down a few years ago. It was popular back when I was in middle school. Everyone used it for public and private blog posting. When they declared they were shutting down the site, everyone was urged to log back in and save all their teenage memories. I forgot my password. No surprise. Though I was ashamed to make an effort to see what my teenage brain was writing about so I didn't save any, but I wish I still had access to these digital memories if I ever wanted to dig out my history.</p>
      <h4>Discussion Questions:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1. How does the loss of platforms like Geocities impact our ability to study the history of the internet and digital culture?</li>
        <li>2. Do you see a full circle in the digital world that Geocities's spirit kinda sounds like blockchain nowadays?

        </li>

      <h2>Week 5</h2>
      <h3>David Reinfurt: Selections from A *New* Program for Graphic Design</h3>
      <p>I usually prefer a physical book for reading because blue light really is damaging our eyes, especially for kids whose eyes haven't grown completely for enough protection. But I think incorporating Augmented Reality is giving traditional books a new dimension of how mixed reality/media could work. Say, projecting a T-Rex with a phone from the code printed on the book can help children learn both in words and visually. So I definitely agree the future of printing is a combination of both physical and digital but not one or the other.</p>
      <h4>Discussion Questions:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1. How can publishers balance digital convenience with the unique qualities of print to create engaging, sustainable hybrid publishing models?</li>
        <li>2. Will the rise of print as an art form or collectible object make it more exclusive, or can it still remain an accessible medium for communication and activism?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h2>Week 7</h2>
      <h3>Paul Soulellis: Performing the Feed</h3>
      <p>One of the most compelling aspects of the workbook is its recognition of alt-text as a form of translation—a process where visual details must be carefully transformed into words, considering what is most important for the audience. This aligns with broader conversations about how accessibility should not be treated as an afterthought but as an integral part of design and communication.

        I only knew of alt as a marketing tool. People always talk about having as many relevant keywords in the alt section on a website as possible. But now reading this article, I have a deeper understanding of what alt text can really do. There's a wider and deeper meaning to it.
        
        </p>
      <h4>Discussion Questions:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1. How does viewing alt-text as a form of poetry change the way we think about accessibility and digital inclusion? Do you think this creative approach makes alt-text more effective, or could it introduce challenges in ensuring clarity and objectivity?

        </li>
        <li>2. The workbook discusses alt-text as a process of translation—converting visual elements into words. What are some of the biggest challenges in this translation process, and how can we balance creativity with accuracy in making alt-text both engaging and informative?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="week">
      <h2>Week 8</h2>
      <h3>Bojana Coklyat & Shannon Finnegan: Selections from Alt-Text as Poetry</h3>
      <p>Nasser’s argument challenges the assumption that technology is universally accessible by highlighting the deep-rooted English bias in programming and digital systems. His critique of OLPC’s linguistic contradictions resonates with broader discussions about the gap between intention and implementation in global technology initiatives.

        One of the most striking aspects of the essay is the failure of digital systems to properly support non-Latin scripts. The idea that Arabic text is frequently rendered incorrectly in major products, from Google Ads to video games, exposes how non-Western languages remain an afterthought in software development. This failure goes beyond inconvenience—it reflects a systemic issue in the prioritization of cultural accessibility in tech.</p>
      <h4>Discussion Questions:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1. What are the ethical and practical implications of programming being almost exclusively tied to the English language? Should efforts be made to create more multilingual programming environments, or is English dominance inevitable?</li>
        <li>2. Nasser suggests that many digital systems (e.g., typography, UI frameworks) fail to support non-Latin scripts properly. How might greater diversity in software development teams help address these biases? What structural changes would be necessary to make digital systems more inclusive?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Week 10</h2>
      <h3>Ben Duvall: Selections from New Modernism(s)</h3>
      <p>I've taken psychology classes previously so it's interesting to actually think about how graphic design leverages the Gestalt theory instead of just intuitively using it in design. In relation to web design, it helps to understand how principles like proximity, similarity, and closure shape our perception of visual information, offering ways to design more cohesive and intuitive experiences rather than focusing solely on individual elements. 

        A part that I liked a lot was the discussion of apparent movement and how we fill in the gaps between discrete frames to create a sense of motion. I think there's possibilities to explore this further in web design to possibly make smarter designs for things like animations and transitions. 
        
        </p>
      <h4>Discussion Questions:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1. How might the idea of "the whole being different from the sum of its parts" challenge traditional approaches to web design, such as modular design systems?</li>
        <li>2. Is simplicity always necessarily better? Do things necessarily need to be coherent in a web-based setting?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Week 12</h2>
      <h3>Neta Bomani & Sabii Borno: Beyond Dark Matter</h3>
      <p>ibendum. Vivamus nec enim mi.Dot Tuer argues that while String Games was prescient in its incorporation of rules, interactivity, and networked communication—traits that would later define new media—it goes beyond the digital frame by engaging with a "poetics of absence." The ephemeral, improvised gestures and the lack of a material string become metaphors for the gaps in memory and history, especially in a world increasingly mediated by screens. The later work Body Missing builds on this, transforming the virtual thread into a mourning archive of loss and historical trauma.

        What stands out is how Frenkel consistently anticipates and critiques the evolution of media—seeing technology not just as a tool for connection, but as a space where memory, displacement, and archival silences are deeply entangled. Her work encourages viewers to consider not just what is present on the screen, but what is missing—what has been lost, obscured, or forgotten.>Discussion Questions:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1. Frenkel’s concept of “poetics of absence” suggests that what is not seen or said is just as important as what is. How can this idea reshape the way we think about digital archives and the history they represent or omit?</li>
        <li>2. In what ways does String Games challenge our assumptions about virtual presence and interactivity in digital media? Can we still find space for improvisation and ambiguity in today’s hyper-mediated environments?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="week">
      <h2>Week 13</h2>
      <h3>Laurel Schwulst: Excerpts from Personal Websites</h3>
      <p>One of the most powerful insights in Paul's writing is how today’s publishing is less about singular, meaningful interruptions (like books, posters, or articles), and more about continuous flows — livestreams, algorithmically generated content, chat bots, and social feeds. These are not events; they are ambient presences. Soulellis connects this to a kind of “new boredom,” where we watch not because the content is inherently interesting, but because others are watching too — and we’re afraid to miss something.

        It also pushes readers to question their own roles as watchers, participants, and creators within these feeds. Rather than rejecting digital media, Soulellis proposes that we need new forms of resistance: archiving, printing, disrupting, and seeing feeds differently. He encourages us to look for breaks, leaks, and gaps in the smooth stream — to develop new perceptual tools for navigating a media environment shaped by algorithms and automation.</p>
      <h4>Discussion Questions:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1. How does Soulellis’ concept of the “new boredom” challenge our understanding of engagement and attention in digital culture?

        </li>
        <li>2. How does the shift from posts to feeds change our understanding of what it means to “publish” something today?
            Do you think something still counts as "publishing" if it is continuous, algorithmically generated, or devoid of human authorship? Why or why no</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="week">
        <h2>Week 14</h2>
        <h3>Neta Bomani & Sabii Borno - Beyond Dark Matter from Logic Issue 15 Beacons</h3>
        <p>Beyond Dark Matter is a poetic and speculative allegory that uses science fiction to critique the hidden architectures of power embedded in computing systems. Through the journey of Gem—a young Black student navigating both the pressures of school and the mysteries of her computer—the authors reveal how contemporary technologies often replicate historical systems of control, particularly through the use of terms like “master/slave” and the narratives embedded in software.

            As Gem is drawn into a strange software update called "The Way," she embarks on a disorienting but enlightening journey through her own digital memory, learning about the legacy of computing, systemic surveillance, and the erasure of Black political history. What starts as a malfunction becomes a deeply emotional and historical reckoning with how algorithms and interfaces can both empower and alienate.</p>
        <h4>Discussion Questions:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>1. How does the metaphor of “The Way” represent modern computing systems, and what does “The Beyond” offer as an alternative framework?
          </li>
          <li>2. What responsibilities do educators, programmers, and designers have in confronting or changing the language and logic embedded in the tools we use?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Week 15</h2>
        <h3>Boris Groys - Art on the Internet</h3>
        <p> Boris Groys examines how the digital shift has radically altered the production, distribution, and perception of art. He argues that the Internet has dissolved the traditional boundary between the space of art creation and the space of art exhibition, making the creative process immediately visible and surveilled. Unlike the museum or gallery, the Internet is not a neutral, contemplative space but one of exposure, data tracking, and algorithmic framing. Artists are no longer hidden creators but public participants whose every click is recorded, quantified, and commodified.

        </p>
        <h4>Discussion Questions:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>1. Do you think radical transparency on the Internet helps or harms artistic expression? How might an artist resist or embrace this environment?
          </li>
          <li>2. How does this shift from “art as fiction” to “art as data” affect the way we interpret, value, or even create art today?</li>
